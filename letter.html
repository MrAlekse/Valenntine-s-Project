        <h2>My Dearest Mikylla</h2>
        <p><i> I know our relationship ended some time ago, and I want to start by saying this sincerely: I was wrong. I hurt you by neglecting you and your feelings, and I take full responsibility for that.
            You were the kindest, most understanding, and most loving person I’ve ever met. You were always there for me, even at my lowest. But when you were struggling, I wasn’t there the way I should have been. I put myself first, and that was selfish. I’m truly sorry.
            I also regret that when our relationship was falling apart, I didn’t fight for us. Instead, I let you go without doing anything—without showing how much you truly meant to me. And to make things worse, I repaid your love with pain and betrayal. I’m deeply sorry for that.
            There’s been a constant conflict inside me. My mind tells me to leave you alone, to stop bothering you. But my heart still cares for you, still thinks about you, still hopes for you.
            If you’d allow it, I want to court you again—not to rush things, not to erase what happened, but to start fresh and do things right this time. I want to build something new with you, where trust is the foundation, not lust. To make new memories, better ones, and to love you the way you truly deserve.
            I never wanted to lose you. And I’m sorry that I didn’t realize that sooner.
          Hindi ko alam bakit hinihintay pa rin kita kahit hindi na dapat,
