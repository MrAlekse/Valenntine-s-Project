        <!--<h2>My Dearest Mikylla</h2>
        
        <p><i> Advance Happy Valentine’s day ky, before you get curious why I did this eventhough are relationship ended last year, 
          unfortunately. I just want to let you know that you will always have a special place in my heart even, if your not my girl 
          anymore. I made this little effort to show you how much I appriaciate you and the time we spent together. Even though my effort is to late
          I still want to say sorry for the things I did wrong and the things I couldn’t give you when we were together. I hope that you find happiness
          in your life even if my presence is no longer in your life. I want to thank you for the memories, the love, the care and the lessons you taught me.
          Your more than just a girlfriend you were also a mother that teach me the right things. I hope that you can forgive me for the things I did. I want to share to youwmy favorite quote it goes like this
          "Always do better till you know better and when you know better, then do better" I hope that you achieve all your dreams and goals in life. I will always be here to support you from afar.
          I wish you all the best in life and love. Happy Valentine’s day my dear Mik
        </i></p>
        

        I commented the letter because I just discover something that hurts and Its to late to cancel what I have planned for.

        But I hope she happy now. I always know this day will come maybe I was just a temporary man for her because they were at long distance that time but now we're in distant apart and they're in the same campus it hurt but I don't have a right to be hurt. Still it is not my intention to make her mine again. I know she will not be available to read this cause she dont know how 
        -->
        <h2><!--Never Mind the letter. I hope your happy with him. Now we're even :> but if your really curious about it ask someone who can read hidden message I will noterase the letter😉-->

 <h2> This past few weeks I've been thinking and revising this letter over and over but I really don't know what to say to be honest. Happy Valentine's day Mikylla, enjoy tomorrow:* I hope somehow this little effort make you happy?.
